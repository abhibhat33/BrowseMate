# React Native Browse Mate App

## Overview
Browse Mate is a React Native mobile application implementing Firebase Authentication and a data-driven interface with search and filter functionalities. The app is developed for both iOS and Android and consists of four main screens:

- **Login Screen** - Firebase authentication for login.
- **Signup Screen** - User registration with Firebase.
- **Home Screen** - Displays a list of items from dummy JSON.
- **Details Screen** - Shows detailed information about a selected item.

The project follows best coding practices, including **Redux** for state management and middleware for API calls.

## ðŸ”’ Security Note
This project uses **dotenv** to manage sensitive environment variables securely. To ensure the security of API keys and Firebase credentials, store them in a `.env` file and never commit them to version control.
